# Predicting Soil Reaction Front Using Hybrid Neural Network

This repo contains source codes, input data, and an example output for the hybrid neural network proposed in the article Wen et al. (2022), which targets improving the accuracy of a physics-based model in simulating soil reaction front using the neural network.

## Get Started

0. Make sure all of the above dependencies are installed before running the code

1. Specify parameters in the final.py
Hyperparameters:
```
WHETHER_TRAIN = True  ## Training the model from scratch. If using the pre-trained model, please set it to False.
ONLYBEST = True       ## Only train/test the best performance models ['7a', '7b', '9a', '11a', '11c', '14a','14b']; Set to False if training all models.
HOME_DIR = "./test"   ## Define the directory where the result will be saved.
```

2. Input data: Input data is saved in data/all_data.csv

3. Run the finaly.py script.

```
python final.py
```
